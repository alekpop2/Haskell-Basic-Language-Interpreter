# Haskell-Basic-Language-Interpreter
Created a basic interpreter that parses and translates input expressions into output values in a hypothetical language. Handles all common key words as well as user-defined functions and procedures. Generates closures and maintains environment to allow for new expressions to be implemented throughout the duration of a given program.
